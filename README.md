While at GHP, one of the physics professors wanted a custom mades simulation set for his students about basic kinematics and dynamics concepts. So,
I was one of the students that helped him out with this project. I incorporated calculus and other physics concepts to write a graphically engaging
simulation using JavaScript's P5 framework.
